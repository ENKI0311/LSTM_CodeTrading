Here's a professional and concise README template for your **LSTM_CodeTrading** project:

---

# LSTM CodeTrading

## Overview
**LSTM CodeTrading** is a deep learning-based framework for building and testing trading strategies using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. This project aims to predict financial market trends by leveraging sequential data and time-series analysis, providing insights for informed trading decisions.

---

## Features
- **LSTM Model Architecture**: Leverages LSTM networks for capturing temporal dependencies in financial data.
- **Customizable Trading Strategies**: Enables backtesting and evaluation of user-defined strategies.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes modules for handling and cleaning time-series data.
- **Visualization Tools**: Provides charts and metrics to evaluate model performance and trading results.

---

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Any other dependencies specific to your project

Install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ENKI0311/LSTM_CodeTrading.git
   cd LSTM_CodeTrading
   ```

2. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   - Place your historical financial data in the `data/` directory.
   - Ensure the data is in a CSV format with appropriate columns (e.g., Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).

3. **Train the Model**:
   Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

4. **Backtest the Strategy**:
   Evaluate the strategy's performance:
   ```bash
   python backtest.py
   ```
